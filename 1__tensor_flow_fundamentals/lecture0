Tensor flow its a mathematical 

A flow graph 
2 units
    nodes operations
    edges tensor

Tensor is a multidimentional array
    value, vector, matrix,n-dimensional array


Place holder are holes, inwhic the data needs to be inserted to execute the data, like parameters in a fuction

Tensor flow variables are used to perserved some variables that are persistant ine the code

Tensor flow allowa to run aplications in any type of device

Built in support for neural networks and deep learning

With python Eager execution 

Keras is a High level api for tensor flow, but it uses the tensor flow execution engine

Tensor flow 2.0 have performance improvements and GPU enhancements 



What is eager execution mode?
    The code that is written gets execute as when its run, which is more intuitive and easier for newcomers

The low level api requieres the knowledge of linear algebra
