Gradient tape

    records all the opeations inside the context, 
    it is able to compute gradients for variables that are being whatch

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    #everithing declare in this context is being whatch, therefore diferentiable
    #tf.constant declare autside are not beign whatch
    whatch(some_thing)//make somethin

    y=2

    #gradient=tape.gradient('what to diferentiate','with respecto to what ')
    #gradient is
