Linear regression 

Let Y= a*X+b

Then we say that Y depends on X

Given some data  linear regression is the process of finding the line, plane or hyperplane, that better fits the given data

If X is one dimensional them the process is a simple linear regression

If X is two dimensional or above, them is call multiple linear regression

If X and Y are multi-dimensional them it's call multivariate linear regression
